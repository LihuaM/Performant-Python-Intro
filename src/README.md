# Notes

The code in this directory is for teaching purposes. As such many of the programming choices made in writing it were towards the end of easier to explain code. In addition, as the topic being taught in this repository is numeric python, the focus is not on the most cutting edge of k-means techniques. Nor does it embrace Python's object oriented paradigm which would likely prefer that the algorithm be implemented as a class.

The `demo.py` script is equipped with flags to perform different demonstrations. Help for this function can be found by running `python demo.py -h` at the command line.
